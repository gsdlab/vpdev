vpdev: Virtual Platform Development Tool
========================================

Virtual Platform
----------------

Virtual platform is a way of achieving some benefits of clone-and-own and product-line engineering (PLE) approaches at the same time while avoiding the drawbacks of these approaches.
A virtual platform plays a similar role to the integrated platform in PLE with a difference that the features and the associated reusable assets are distributed among the cloned projects instead of being integrated into a platform.
The virtual platform with only one project is simply *feature-oriented development*.
